# EX-02 - Cross-Platform Prompting: Evaluating Diverse Techniques in AI-Powered Text Summarization
### AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

### Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary based on the following evaluation metrics:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User Experience

### Algorithm
STEP 1: Select Source Text:
Choose a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology".

STEP 2: Define Prompting Techniques:

1.Zero-shot: Provide the text and ask for a summary directly.

2.Few-shot: Provide examples of summarized texts before asking for a new summary.

3.Chain-of-thought (CoT): Ask the model to reason step-by-step before summarizing.

4.Role-based: Instruct the model to act as a professor, student, or explainer before summarizing.

STEP 3 : Choose AI Platforms:

ChatGPT

Google Gemini

Claude (Anthropic)

Microsoft Copilot (Bing AI)

STEP 4 : Apply Prompting Techniques:
For each platform, use each of the 4 prompting strategies to summarize the same text.

STEP 5 : Collect Outputs:
Store and label all 16 outputs (4 platforms Ã— 4 prompting techniques).

STEP 6 : Evaluate:
Score each output based on the following criteria:

Accuracy (1-5): How factually correct is the summary?

Coherence (1-5): Is the summary logically structured?

Simplicity (1-5): Is it easy to understand for undergraduates?

Speed (sec): Time taken to generate the summary.

User Experience (1-5): Subjective ease of use of platform and clarity of results.

STEP 7 :Rank and Analyze Results:
Create a table of scores and rank the combinations.

STEP 8 :Conclusion:
Identify the most effective prompting + platform combination.
